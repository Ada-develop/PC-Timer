# Shutdown.py
Simple CMD style, computer shutdown timer, that was create by me to myself daily tasks. 

For example, you are downloading heavy file and downloading time is near about 4 hours and you go outside to meet your friends, but don't want agree that your computer will be still working after file downloading and waiting for your shutdown click, So you can just activate this simple PC Timer.py.

Timer.py - Pure code

Timer.exe - Executable file of Timer.py, which you can use in your daily Tasks.

How I converted .py file to .exe was used pyinstaller :

1. pip install pyinstaller
2. Make path to your .py code through CMD
3. pyinstaller --onefile {file-name}
4. In folder dist will locate your .exe file
